Welcome to my blog! I'm David Torres, a software engineer with strong interest on backend, architecture, design patterns, etc.

During my career (almost 14 years!) I have been coding in different languages, and using different frameworks.: Java, Spring, Spring Boot, C, C++, Python, Kotlin and then... I found Go.

<!-- more -->

Yes, I love [Go](https://play.golang.org/). With the same effort that you would need in different languages you get a much more quality code (in terms of readibility and maintainability) and very efficient results, with nearly the performance you get in C/C++ or Rust.

This blog begins a journey. I have decided to focus my career to polish my code skills, revisiting the well-known principles (SOLID design, clean code, etc.) and learning the newest techniques and tools to achieve the best results in terms of quality and performance.
