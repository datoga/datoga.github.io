                I'm <strong>David Torres</strong>, a software engineer with a
                strong interest in backend development, architecture, and design
                patterns.

                During my career (almost 14 years!) I have been coding in
                different languages and using different frameworks: Java,
                Spring, Spring Boot, C, C++, Python, Kotlin and then... I found <strong
                    >Go</strong
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I love <a
                    href="https://go.dev/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">Go</a
                >. With the same effort that you would need in different
                languages, you get much higher quality code (in terms of
                readability and maintainability) and very efficient results,
                with nearly the performance you get in C/C++ or Rust.
            </p>

                This blog is a journey where I focus on polishing my code
                skills, revisiting the well-known principles (SOLID design,
                clean code, etc.) and learning the newest techniques and tools
                to achieve the best results in terms of quality and performance.
